# OOOlledj-screenshoter
Simple screenshoter I wrote on python using several python modules.
Have to say, it was written and tested on Linux, but it shoul work for windows and else, because was not designed fro any OS specifications

Using modules:
* External: pyautogui, keyboard, PyQt5
* Python3: time, os, sys, treceback

Features:
* Directory selection and notification
* Hotkey selection and notification
* Screens has unique name which is: DDMMYYYY-HHMMSS-mSmSmS.png

Well, that is all for now :D
Use it as you want, comments are welcome!
